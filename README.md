# Names Binary Classification

Using integer representing unicode for each character in first names to predict gender. 
This is a quick exploration into the interesting problem.

I have implemented a LighGBM Classifier approach and an RNN approach. 

## Dataset 
 Aggregate of multiple smaller datasets representing various cultures into a large dataset (130k instances) of gender-labeled first names and divided in train and test.
